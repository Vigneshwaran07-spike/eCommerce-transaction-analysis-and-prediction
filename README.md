# Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with business insights, building a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers, and using clustering techniques for customer segmentation. The deliverables include Jupyter Notebooks, reports, and a Lookalike.csv file.

## Tasks
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform thorough analysis to extract business insights.
2. **Lookalike Model:** Build a model that recommends similar customers based on existing data.
3. **Customer Segmentation:** Use clustering techniques to segment customers into meaningful groups.

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebooks** containing the steps for EDA, model building, and clustering.
- **Lookalike.csv**: A file containing the recommended lookalike customers.
- **Reports**: A comprehensive report summarizing findings and insights.

**Run Jupyter Notebooks:**
Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to execute the analysis and model.

**Generate Lookalike.csv** by running the lookalike model notebook.

## Notes
- Ensure that the required libraries and dependencies are installed for the notebooks to run correctly.
